# Chrome extensions

Contains extension utilities for Chromium-based browsers.

## Autoclose tabs

Periodically checks for predefined collection of tabs. If the tab was open for an hour, it's closed. Currently set to close tabs with OpenAI or ChatGpt. Extension is intentionally not packaged into .crx file so that everyone can inspect the code and uses a default "hi" icon.

### Installation

2. Go to `Extensions` tab in Chrome (or other Chromium-based browser).
3. Enable `Developer mode` in the top-right corner.
4. Select `Load unpacked` in the top left corner.
